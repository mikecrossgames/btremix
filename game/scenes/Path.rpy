    Johan "There is something... but certainly not as good as this, which is at another level"
    Villager2 "Hahahahaha great, we came to relax a bit before the end of the festival, we brought some craft beer that my dad makes"
    Villager2 "Do you want? we have brought plenty"
    Leyna "I don't know if we should.... we have been drinking a lot lately"
    Johan "Well let's drink anyway, it's the last day of the festival so I guess we should do what everyone else does, don't you think?"
